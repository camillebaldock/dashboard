    quotes:
      - "The two-minute rule is magic."
      - "My best trick is costume - the clothing I put on or take off. If I put on exercise gear, I’ll start to feel like exercising; if I don’t, I’m very likely to feel like doing something else."
      - "Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax."
      - "Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does."
      - "First of all, if it's on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection bucket, that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through."
      - "Most often, the reason something is 'on your mind' is that you want it to be different than it currently is, and yet you haven’t clarified exactly what the intended outcome is; you haven’t decided what the very next physical action step is; and/or you haven’t put reminders of the outcome and the action required in a system you trust."
      - "There is no reason ever to have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought."
      - "We (1) collect things that command our attention; (2) process what they mean and what to do about them; and (3) organize the results, which we (4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do."
      - "Most people feel best about their work the week before their vacation, but it’s not because of the vacation itself. What do you do the last week before you leave on a big trip? You clean up, close up, clarify, and renegotiate all your agreements with yourself and others. I just suggest that you do this weekly instead of yearly."

          Here are just some of the benefits of asking “why?”
          It defines success.
          It creates decision-making criteria.
          It aligns resources.
          It motivates.
          It clarifies focus.
          It expands options.

    quotes:
      - "The office during the day has become the last place people want to be when they really want to get work done. That’s because offices have become interruption factories."
      - "Stop commuting your life away."
      - "The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time. Once you’ve had a taste of that life, no corner office or fancy chef will be able to drag you back."
      - "Worth counting too is the number of days you spend at the office emailing someone who sits only three desks away."
      - "Most work is not coming up with The Next Big Thing. Rather, it’s making better the thing you already thought of six months—or six years—ago."
      - "Our attitude is, we need a clean plate before going up for seconds."
      - "InterGuard alone claims ten thousand clients, and research group Gartner estimates that 60 percent of employees will suffer from some sort of Big Brother invasion by 2015."
      - "As Sir Richard Branson commented in his ode to working remotely, 'To successfully work with other people, you have to trust each other. A big part of this is trusting people to get their work done wherever they are, without supervision.'"
      - "If you’re working on the couch in front of the TV, well, it’s tempting to reach for the remote. If you’re sitting in the kitchen, you may find yourself thinking of emptying the dishwasher. But if you’re sitting in a dedicated room intended for work with the door closed, you stand a far better chance of staying on task."
      - "The best cultures derive from actions people actually take, not the ones they write about in a mission statement."
      - "It’s almost zen-like to let go of the frenzy, to let answers flow back to you when the other party is ready to assist. Use that calm to be even more productive."
      - "It’s rarely spelled out directly, but a lot of the arguments against working remotely are based on the fear of losing control."
      - "Because reptilian resistance is not rational but deeply emotional—even instinctual—the excuse 'but I’ll lose control' is the toughest to overcome."
      - "When you and your coworkers are sitting in the same place, it’s easy to feel that you’re up to speed on what’s going on in the company. […] Working remotely doesn’t automatically create that flow."
      - "We believe that these staples of work life—meetings and managers—are actually the greatest causes of work not getting done at the office."
      - "Constantly asking people what they’re working on prevents them from actually doing the work they’re describing."
      - "All those dreaded status meetings, interruptions for estimates, and planning sessions have a curious way of adding up exactly to a manager’s workweek."
      - "A manager’s natural instinct is to worry about his workers not getting enough work done, but the real threat is that too much will likely get done. And because the manager isn’t sitting across from his worker anymore, he can’t look in the person’s eyes and see burnout."
      - "If anything, the human connection is even more important when hiring remote workers because it has to be stronger to survive the distance."
      - "That’s one of the key challenges of remote work. Keeping everyone’s outlook healthy and happy. That task is insurmountable if you’ve stacked your team with personalities who tend to let their inner asshole loose every now and again."
      - "The old adage still applies. No assholes allowed. But for remote work, you need to extend it to no asshole-y behavior allowed, no drama allowed, no bad vibes allowed."
      - "When you’re seeking remote workers, you have to do even more to encourage and nurture diversity and personal development."

      - "I turned in a lab report written from the rat's point of view. The report described how, merely by pressing a bar, it had trained a college student to engage in breakfast-feeding behavior."
      - "It is an integral part of the American myth that anyone who sets his mind to it can succeed, that diligence eventually pays off."
      - "Likewise, when we call out a hearty 'Good girl!' in response to a child's performance, the most appropriate reply would seem to be 'Woof!'"

    author: "Margaret Atwood"
    quotes:
      - "Waste not want not. I am not being wasted. Why do I want?"
      - "Like other things now, thought must be rationed. There’s a lot that doesn’t bear thinking about. Thinking can hurt your chances, and I intend to last."
      - "There is more than one kind of freedom, said Aunt Lydia. Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don’t underrate it."
      - "We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice."
      - "When we think of the past it’s the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that."

    author: "Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson"
    quotes:
      - "A business without a path to profit isn’t a business, it’s a hobby."
      - "All companies have customers. Lucky companies have fans. But the most fortunate companies have audiences. So build an audience. Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos—whatever. Share information that’s valuable and you’ll slowly but surely build a loyal audience. Then when you need to get the word out, the right people will already be listening."
      - "Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does."
      - "As you get going, keep in mind why you’re doing what you’re doing."
      - "ASAP is poison."
      - "Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else’s shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate."
      - "Companies need to be true to a type of customer more than a specific individual customer with changing needs."
      - "Decisions are progress."
      - "Do it yourself first. NEVER HIRE ANYONE to do a job until you’ve tried to do it yourself first."
      - "Don’t hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain."
      - "Don’t prioritize with numbers or labels. Avoid saying, “This is high priority, this is low priority.” Likewise, don’t say, “This is a three, this is a two, this is a one, this is a three,” etc. Do that and you’ll almost always end up with a ton of really high-priority things. That’s not really prioritizing. Instead, prioritize visually."
      - "Don’t scar on the first cut."
      - "Emulate drug dealers. Make your product so good, so addictive, so “can’t miss” that giving customers a small, free taste makes them come back with cash in hand."
      - "Everyone tries to avoid any conflict or drama. No one says, “This idea sucks.” People appease instead of challenge."
      - "Fancy gear can help, but the truth is your tone comes from you."
      - "Get the chisel out and start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction."
      - "If no one’s upset by what you’re saying, you’re probably not pushing hard enough. (And you’re probably boring, too.)"
      - "If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer. It doesn’t matter if that person is a marketer, salesperson, designer, programmer, or whatever; their writing skills will pay off."
      - "If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out?"
      - "If you start pushing back deadlines and increasing your budget, you’ll never stop."
      - "If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know."
      - "If you want to do something, you’ve got to do it now. You can’t put it on a shelf and wait two months to get around to it. You can’t just say you’ll do it later. Later, you won’t be pumped up about it anymore."
      - "Inspiration is perishable."
      - "INSTANT CULTURES ARE artificial cultures. They’re big bangs made of mission statements, declarations, and rules. They are obvious, ugly, and plastic. Artificial culture is paint. Real culture is patina."
      - "Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach them."
      - "Interruption is the enemy of productivity. Ever notice how much work you get done on a plane since you’re offline and there are zero outside distractions?"
      - "Interviews are only worth so much. Some people sound like pros but don’t work like pros."

          It’s easy to put your head down and just work on what you think needs to be done. It’s a lot harder to pull your head up and ask why.
          Why are you doing this?
          What problem are you solving?
          Is this actually useful?
          Are you adding value?
          Will this change behavior?
          Is there an easier way?
          What could you be doing instead?
      - "Let your customers outgrow you."
      - "Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it. And at a certain point, you just stop looking at it because it makes you feel bad. Then you stress out and the whole thing turns into a big mess."
      - "Make tiny decisions. Big decisions are hard to make and hard to change. And once you make one, the tendency is to continue believing you made the right decision, even if you didn’t. You stop being objective."
      - "Make you part of your product or service. Inject what’s unique about the way you think into what you sell. Decommoditize your product. Make it something no one else can offer."
      - "Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them."
      - "Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365."

      - "Once your product does what it needs to do, get it out there. Just because you’ve still got a list of things to do doesn’t mean it’s not done."
      - "Own your bad news. WHEN SOMETHING GOES wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You’ll be better off if it’s you."
      - "People are creatures of habit. That’s why they react to change in such a negative way. They’re used to using something in a certain way and any change upsets the natural order of things. So they push back. They complain."
      - "Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over again."
      - "Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too - how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it and how you deliver it. Competitors can never copy the you in your product."
      - "Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility. They’re a result of giving people the privacy, workspace, and tools they deserve. Great environments show respect for the people who do the work and how they do it."
      - "Say no by default."
      - "Skip the rock stars."
      - "Software companies don’t usually think about writing books. Bands don’t usually think about filming the recording process. Car manufacturers don’t usually think about selling charcoal. There’s probably something you haven’t thought about that you could sell too."
      - "Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition. Instead of one-upping, try one-downing. Instead of outdoing, try underdoing."
      - "Standing for something isn’t just about writing it down. It’s about believing it and living it."
      - "Start making smaller to-do lists too. Long lists collect dust. When’s the last time you finished a long list of things?"

      - "The real hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get things done."

      - "The way to find the epicenter is to ask yourself this question - If I took this away, would what I’m selling still exist?"

      - "What makes a museum great is the stuff that’s not on the walls. Someone says no. A curator is involved, making conscious decisions about what should stay and what should go."
      - "When you don’t know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious."
      - "Whenever you can, swap “Let’s think about it” for “Let’s decide on it.” Commit to making decisions. Don’t wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward."

      - "You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that."

      - "The problem is that, when they say ‘real people,’ what they mean is people who aren’t burdened with ironic senses of humor, college educations that help them put up an analytical barrier between themselves and the actual world, and the pressure of living with the reality that they all grew up middle class, chose a broke-ass bohemian life, and now have to deal with the fact that they can’t afford the comforts they grew up used to. So they’re colonizing those normal people’s neighborhoods, colonizing their experiences."

      - "When she was twenty she figured out that she was such a mess not because she was trans, but because being trans is so stigmatized. If you could leave civilization for a year, like live in an abandoned shopping mall out in the desert giving yourself injections of estrogen, working on your voice, figuring out how to dress yourself all over again and meditating eight hours a day on gendered socialization, and then get bottom surgery as a reward, it would be pretty easy to transition."

      - "If you don't prioritise your life, someone else will."
      - "[journaling] Capture the headline. Look for the lead in your life, *your* week, *your* life."
      - "If it isn't a clear *yes*, then it's a clear *no*."
      - "Creating an essential intent is hard. It takes courage, insight, foresight to see which activities and efforts will add up to your single highest point of contribution. It takes asking tough questions, making real trade-offs, and exercising serious discipline to cut out the competing priorities that distract us from our true intention. Yet it is worth the effort because only with real clarity of purpose can people, teams, and organisations fully mobivilise and achieve something truly excellent."
      - "But if you really want to improve the overall functioning of the system - whether that system is a manufacturing process, a procedure in your department, or some routine in your daily life - you need to identify the 'slowest hiker'."

    quotes:
      - "Britain's picture is less stark than many, but our dependency ratio is still projected to rise from 54 today to 62 in 2030. Germany's ratio is set to rise from 52 to 70; France's from 56 to 66."
      - "Is China simply further back on the same track as us, or is it travelling down a different path altogether? Does it see a future for itself as a richer and more powerful member of the established global order, or does it plan to go its own way and play by its own rules, overturning the global order as it does so?"
      - "First, our elite should be able to emerge from anywhere in the population, not just from within the existing elite. And secondly, a successfuly elite is not enough in a modern economy; everyone has to be equipped to contribute their skills, their ideas and their endeavour."
      - "Those countries with the best educated populations, the most democratic governance structures, and the most dynamic and open economies will be best placed to exploit the opportunities of the digital revolution; it is closed, centralised, command-and-control economies and political systems that will struggle."
      - "As a rule, when a government is borrowing more than 5 per cent of GDP, it is in difficult territory. When it is borrowing more than 10 per cent, it is in basket-case territory. By 2009 the British Government was running an annual deficit of 11.5 per cent - the highest level in the European Union apart from Greece."
      - "Europe has 7 per cent of the world's population, 23 per cent of the world's economy, but 50 per cent of the world's welfare spending."
      - "Public sector workers are no different from any other workers; we all want to be trusted and valued; we all want to be given the freedom and responsibility to develop and grow; and we all want to work in a dynamic, efficient and responsive organisations that deliver a high quality product or a valued service. Reform needs to tap into, not stifle, these instincts."
      - "Crime, like business, is also constantly evolving, and usually at a faster rate than the public sector. It too has a tendency to gravitate towards the big [...] and the small [...]."
      - "There are to types of elections, 'me' elections and 'we' elections."
      - "On the left we are regaled by a romantic social democracy, in a which a re-inflated, unreformed and highly interventionist state will stand up to capitalist 'predators' while making ordinary workers instantly richer; lowering prices, raising wages and slowing the pace of deficit reduction. On the right is a nostalgic nationalism, with the promise of a detached Britain, glorifying the past, fearful of the future, insulated from the fast-moving and unsentimental reality of globalisation."

    quotes: 
      - "Scientists currently think there are around 10,000 intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy."
      - "This is known in economics as the ‘decoy effect’. What it demonstrates is that the presence of an irrelevant alternative can change how you view your choices."
      - "This setup is known as the ‘stable marriage problem’, and the process through which the friends picked their partners is called the Gale-Shapley algorithm."
      - "The last two points demonstrate a particularly surprising result: in short, the group who do the asking and risk continual rejection actually end up far better off than the group who sit back and accept a suitor’s advances."
      - "In the prisoner’s dilemma, two suspects are being questioned separately about the same crime. They have two choices: to cooperate and stay silent and split the sentence between them, or to defect and rat on their friend."
      - "Tit for tat isn’t about playground squabbling. It’s a strategy that encourages cooperation but punishes exploitation. The mathematical version involves cooperating at first, and then simply copying the previous move of your opponent. They stay cooperative, you stay cooperative. They cheat and defect on you, you cheat and defect on them. They go back to being nice, you go back to being nice."
      - "Instead of knowing how many people you’ll date, the advanced problem only requires you to know how long you expect your dating life to be."
      - "In relationships where both partners consider themselves as happy, bad behaviour is dismissed as unusual: ‘He’s under a lot of stress at the moment’ or ‘No wonder she’s grumpy, she hasn’t had a lot of sleep lately’. Couples in this enviable state will have a deep-seated positive view of their partner, which is only reinforced by any positive behaviour"

    quotes: 
      - "The first time he saw Carl, Lee thought, 'I could use that, if the family jewels weren’t in pawn to Uncle Junk.'"
      - "Death was in every cell of his body. He gave off a faint, greenish steam of decay. Lee imagined he would glow in the dark."
      - "In 1873 the pope issued a bull to the effect there would be no more discussion of the Immaculate Conception. I am issuing a similar bull in regard to that fifty dollars."
      - "Automatic obedience, synthetic schizophrenia, mass-produced to order. That is the Russian dream, and America is not far behind."
      - "The bureaucrats of both countries want the same thing: Control. The superego, the controlling agency, gone cancerous and berserk."
      - "What happens when there is no limit? What is the fate of The Land Where Anything Goes?"
